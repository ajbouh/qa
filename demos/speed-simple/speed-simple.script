# qa minitest

# Qa is a test runner that runs your existing tests
# quickly and intelligently. It does this using
# parallelism, dependency analysis, and file watching.
#
# Qa works with your existing rspec, minitest, or
# test-unit tests.
#

# We'll be using the ruby-mime-types test suite to
# demonstrate running tests in parallel with qa.
#
git remote get-url origin; git reset --hard b0a4457; tree ./test

#
# For comparison, run tests using the existing test runner.
time bundle exec sh -c 'rake test >/dev/null 2>&1'

#
# Now use qa to run the same tests, in parallel.
time bundle exec qa minitest -quiet

#
# Using multiple cores makes a big difference!

#
# Qa does more than just run tests in parallel though. It
# also formats output from individual tests for easy reading.

#
# Let's apply a patch that exercises these features.
git apply ../patches/add-stdout-noise.patch

#
bundle exec qa minitest

#
# Qa also detects slow tests. Look above for the
# üêå  to see the slowest tests and how they compare.

#
# The overall time is about the same as before, but 2+ seconds
# to run just one test?

#
# Let's look at the patch we applied.

git diff -U2

#
# That sleep doesn't belong there!
git checkout test/test_mime_types_loader.rb

#
bundle exec qa minitest

#
# We still have more snails to hunt, but that's better!
